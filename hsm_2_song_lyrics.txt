Goodbye clouds of gray, hello skies of blue
A dip in the pool, a trip to the spa
Endless days in my chaise
The whole world according to moi
Excuse me?
Thank you!
Iced tea imported from England
Lifeguards imported from Spain
Towels imported from Turkey
And turkey imported from Maine
We're gonna relax and renew
You go do!
I want fabulous, that is my simple request
All things fabulous, bigger and better and best
I need something inspiring to help me get along
I need a little fabulous, is that so wrong?
Fetch me my Jimmy Choo flip-flops
Where is my pink Prada tote?
I need my Tiffany hairband
And then I can go for a float
Summer like never before
I want more!
She wants fabulous, that is her simple request
All things fabulous, bigger and better and best
She needs something inspiring to help her get along
She needs a little fabulous, is that so wrong?
Fabulous pool, (Ew) fabulous splash (Read my lips!)
Fabulous parties, even fabulous trash
Fabulous fashion, (No!) fabulous bling (Yeah)
She's gotta have fabulous everything
Nothing to discuss
Everything's got to be perfect
For... Me!
She wants fabulous, that is her simple request (No, not fabulous)
All things fabulous, bigger and better and best (I need fabulous)
She needs something inspiring to help her get along (No, not fabulous)
She needs a little fabulous, is that so wrong? (I need fabulous)
This won't do
That's a bore
That's insulting!
I need more
I need, I need
I need, I need
I need, I need
I need fabulous!
I want fabulous, bring me fabulous
Fabulous hair, fabulous style
Fabulous eyes and that fabulous smile
Oh, I like what I see
I like it a lot
Is this absolutely fabulous?
Fabulous, fabulous, fabulous?
Absolutely...Not!
How did we get from the top of the world
To the bottom of the heap?
I don't recall you mentioning
The boss is such a creep!
We still have the ingredients
To make this summer sweet
Well, I got rags instead of riches
And all these dirty dishes
Just wish I had three wishes
Okay, guys, break it up
We've got to work, work, to work this out
We'll make things right, the sun will shine
If we work, work, there'll be no doubt
We can still save the summer
If we work this out
Dude, what have you gotten us into?
Come on, we can totally turn this thing around!
I'd rather face a seven-footer
Straight up in the post (Yeah)
That sure beats hangin' here
And burnin' someone's toast (Uh-huh)
I needed Benjamins
But this ain't worth the stress
Maybe there's a better way
To fix this greasy mess
We're a champion team, a well-oiled machine
And we've faced tougher problems than this
I know it's a grind, but I'm sure we can find
A way to have fun while we get this job done
We've got to work, work, to work this out
We'll make things right, the sun will shine
Got to work, work, there'll be no doubt
If we all come together, we can work this out
Let's work it!
Tell me what you want
Tell me what you need
A little bit of sugar
A little bit of butter
It's the perfect recipe
Pay day!
It'll taste so sweet
Pay day!
Good enough to eat
Gonna make some motion pictures
Hit the mall with all my sisters
Get tickets to the Knicks and Sixers
Kick it with the music mixers
Buy a ride that suits my style
Lounge around the pool awhile
Make a date with my favorite girl
We've got it made!
Whoa, we've got to work, work, to work this out
We'll make things right, the sun will shine
If we work, work, there'll be no doubt
We can still save the summer
If we work this out
Work this
Gotta work this
We can work this out
Na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, yeah
You are the music in me
You know the words "Once upon a time"
Make you listen, there's a reason
When you dream, there's a chance you'll find
A little laughter
Or happy ever after
You're harmony to the melody
That's echoin' inside my head
A single voice (Single voice)
Above the noise
And like a common thread
Hmm, you're pullin' me
When I hear my favorite song
I know that we belong
Oh, you are the music in me
Yeah, it's livin' in all of us
And it's brought us here because
Because you are the music in me
Na-na-na-na (Oh)
Na-na-na-na (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Na-na-na-na
You are the music in me
It's like I knew you before we met (Before we met)
Can't explain it (Oh-oh)
There's no name for it (No name for it)
I sang you words I've never said
And it was easy (So easy)
Because you see the real me (I see)
As I am, you understand
And that's more than I've ever known
To hear your voice (Hear your voice)
Above the noise (Oh-oh)
And know I'm not alone
Oh, you're singin' to me (Ooh, yeah)
When I hear my favorite song
I know that we belong (Yeah, oh)
You are the music in me
It's livin' in all of us
And it's brought us here because
You are the music in me
Together, we're gonna sing, yeah
We got the power to say what we feel (What we feel)
Connected and real
Can't keep it all inside, oh-oh (Oh, yeah)
[Chorus: Company, Troy & Gabriella]
When I hear my favorite song (Favorite song)
I know that we belong (We belong)
Oh, you are the music in me
Yeah, it's livin' in all of us
It's brought us here because (Here because)
You are the music in me
Hey, oh!
Play ball!
Hey, hey, woo!
Hey, batter, batter, hey batter, batter swing
I got to just do my thing
Hey, batter, batter, hey batter, batter swing
I'll show you that it's one and the same
Baseball, dancin', same game
It's easy
Step up to the plate
Start swingin'
I wanna play ball now, and that's all
This is what I do
It ain't no dance that you can show me
(Hey, hey, hey) Yeah
You'll never know
Oh, I know
If you never try
There's just one little thing
That stops me every time, yeah
Come on!
I don't dance
I know you can
Not a chance, no
If I can do this, well
You can do that
But I don't dance
Hit it outta the park!
I don't dance
I say you can
There's not a chance, oh
Slide home, you score
Swingin' on the dance floor
I don't dance, no
Hey, batter, batter, hey batter, batter swing
I got to just do my thing
Hey, batter, batter, hey batter, batter swing
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Two-steppin', now you're up to bat
Bases loaded, do your dance
It's easy
Take your best shot
Just hit it!
I've got what it takes playin' my game
So you better spin that pitch you're gonna throw me, yeah
I'll show you how I swing
You'll never know
Oh, I know
If you never try
There's just one little thing
That stops me every time
Yeah
Come on!
I don't dance
I know you can
Not a chance, no, no
If I can do this, well
You can do that
But I don't dance
Hit it outta the park!
I don't dance
I say you can
There's not a chance, oh, no
Slide home, you score
Swingin' on the dance floor
I don't dance, no
Lean back, tuck it in, take a chance
Swing it out, spin around, do the dance
I wanna play ball, not dancehall
I'm makin' a triple, not a curtain call
I can prove it to you 'til you know it's true
'Cause I can swing it, I can bring it to the diamond too
You're talkin' a lot
Show me what you got
Stop, swing!
Hey!
C'mon, swing it like this (Yeah)
(Drr) Oh
Swing! (C'mon)
Jitterbug, brrr (Just like that) da-da, da-da, da-da, da-da, da
That's what I mean
That's how you swing
You make a good pitch, but I don't believe
I say you can
I know I can't
I don't dance
You can do it
I don't dance, no
Nothin' to it
Atta boy, atta boy, yeah
Hey, batter, batter, hey, batter, batter, what?
One, two, three, four, everybody swing
Come on!
I don't dance
I know you can
Not a chance, no, no
If I can do this, well
You can do that
But I don't dance
Hit it outta the park!
I don't dance
I say you can
There's not a chance, oh
Slide home, you score
Swingin' on the dance floor
I don't dance, no
Troy, listen
I gotta say what's on my mind
Somethin' about us doesn't seem right these days
Life keeps gettin' in the way
Whenever we try, somehow, the plan is always rearranged
It's so hard to say
But I gotta do what's best for me
You'll be okay
I've got to move on and be who I am
I just don't belong here, I hope you understand
We might find our place in this world someday
But at least for now
I gotta go my own way (My own way)
Don't wanna leave it all behind
But I get my hopes up
And I watch them fall every time
Another color turns to gray
And it's just too hard to watch it all slowly fade away
I'm leavin' today
'Cause I gotta do what's best for me
You'll be okay
I've got to move on and be who I am
I just don't belong here, I hope you understand
We might find our place in this world someday
But at least for now
I gotta go my own way
What about us?
What about everything we've been through?
And what about trust?
You know I never wanted to hurt you
And what about me?
What am I supposed to do?
I gotta leave but I'll miss you, oh
So, I've got to move on and be who I am
(Why do you have to go?)
I just don't belong here, I hope you understand
(I'm trying to understand)
We might find our place in this world someday
But at least for now
(I want you to stay)
I gotta go my own way
I've got to move on and be who I am
(What about us?)
I just don't belong here, I hope you understand
(I'm trying to understand)
We might find our place in this world someday (World someday)
But at least for now
I gotta go my own way
Everybody's always talkin' at me
Everybody's tryin' to get in my head
I wanna listen to my own heart talkin'
I need to count on myself instead
(Did you ever) Lose yourself to get what you want?
(Did you ever) Get on a ride, then wanna get off?
(Did you ever) Push away the ones you should've held close?
Did you ever let go? Did you ever not know?
I'm not gonna stop, that's who I am
I'll give it all I got, that is my plan
Will I find what I lost? You know you can
Bet on it, bet on it, bet on it, bet on it (Bet on me)
I wanna make it right, that is the way
To turn my life around, today is the day
Am I the type of guy who means what I say?
Bet on it, bet on it, bet on it, bet on it
How will I know if there's a path worth takin'?
Should I question every move I make?
With all I've lost, my heart is breakin'
I don't wanna make the same mistakes
(Did you ever) Doubt your dream will ever come true?
(Did you ever) Blame the world, but never blame you?
(I will never) Try to live a lie again
I don't wanna win this game if I can't play it my way
I'm not gonna stop, that's who I am (Who I am)
I'll give it all I got, that is my plan (That's my plan)
Will I find what I lost? You know you can (You know you can)
Bet on it, bet on it, bet on it, bet on it (Bet on me)
I wanna make it right, that is the way
To turn my life around, today is the day
Am I the type of guy who means what I say?
Bet on it, bet on it, bet on it, bet on it
Oh, hold up
Gimme room to think, bring it on down
Gotta work on my swing, gotta do my own thing
Oh, hold up
It's no good at all to see yourself
And not recognize your face
Out on my own, it's such a scary place, ooh
The answers are all inside of me
All I gotta do is believe
I'm not gonna stop
Not gonna stop 'til I get my shot
That's who I am, that is my plan
Will I end up on top? You can
Bet on it, bet on it, bet on it, bet on—, you can
Bet on it, bet on it, bet on it, bet on it (Bet on me)
I wanna make it right, that is the way
To turn my life around, today is the day
Am I the type of guy who means what I say?
Bet on it, bet on it, bet on it, bet on it (You can bet on me)
Once in a lifetime
Means there's no second chance
So I believe that you and me
Should grab it while we can
Make it last forever
And never give it back
It's our turn and I'm lovin' where we're at
Because this moment's really all we have
Every day of our lives
Wanna find you there, wanna hold on tight
Gonna run while we're young
And keep the faith
Every day from right now
Gonna use our voices and scream out loud
Take my hand
Together we will celebrate (Celebrate)
Oh, every day
They say that you should follow
And chase down what you dream
But if you get lost and lose yourself
What does it really mean?
Oh, no matter where we're goin'
Ooh, yeah, it starts from where we are
There's more to life when we listen to our hearts
And because of you, I've got the strength to start
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Every day of our lives
Wanna find you there, wanna hold on tight
Gonna run while we're young
And keep the faith (Oh)
Every day from right now

We're takin' it back, we're doin' it here together
It's better like that
And stronger now than ever

That's how it's gonna be
Every day of our lives
Wanna find you there, wanna hold on tight
Gonna run while we're young
And keep the faith, keep the faith
Every day of our lives
Wanna find you there, wanna hold on tight
Gonna run (Gonna run) while we're young
And keep the faith (Oh, yeah-yeah)
Every day (Every day) from right now (Right now)
Gonna use our voices and scream out loud
