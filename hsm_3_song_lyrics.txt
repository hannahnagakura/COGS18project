And let the music be your guide
Won't you promise me? (Now won't you promise me)
That you'll never forget?
We'll keep dancin' (To keep dancin')
Wherever we go next
It's like catchin' lightnin'
The chances of findin' someone like you
It's one in a million
The chances of feelin' the way we do
And with every step together
We just keep on gettin' better
So can I have this dance? (Can I have this dance?)
Can I have this dance?
Take my hand, I'll take the lead
And every turn will be safe with me
Don't be afraid, afraid to fall
You know I'll catch you through it all
And you can't keep us apart (Even a thousand miles can't keep us apart)
'Cause my heart is ('Cause my heart is) wherever you are
It's like catchin' lightnin'

Can't back out, can't back out
Gettin' ready (Ready) (Huh?)
For the night of nights (Uh-huh)
The night of nights, alright
Don't panic
Panic!
Now do we have to dress up for the prom?
Dude, I don't think we have the choice (Uh)
Yeah, it's the night of all nights, gotta look just right (Yeah)
Dressin' to impress the boys
Do I want classic or vintage or plaid?
Where's the mirror?
I think this tux is too baggy
Too tight, it makes me look weird
Should I go movie star glamorous?
Sassy or sweet?
Don't know, but no one better wear the same dress as me!
It's the night of our nightmares
It's the night of our dreams
It's too late to back out of it
Hey! Makeovers, massages
Don't know what a corsage is
Been waitin' all our lives for this
It's gonna be a night
Can't wait
To remember
Aw, man
Come on, now
Big fun, alright!
It's gonna be the night
I guess
To last forever
Lucky us

Gettin' ready
Get ready
Get, a-gettin' ready, ready

Should I fluff it?
It's getting late, I already should be there
Her mother opens the door
I'm shakin' inside (Yeah)
He's here, it's time
The hour's arrived
Don't know why her father's starin' me down
Where's my purse, lip gloss?

Then something changes my world
The most beautiful girl
Right in front of my eyes
It's gonna be a night
To remember

Hear the crowd
And never, ever, ever, never
Ever, ever, never, ever
Never, ever, ever forget!
I got a lot of things I have to do
All these distractions, our future's comin' soon
We're being pulled a hundred different directions
But whatever happens, I know I've got you
You're on my mind, you're in my heart
It doesn't matter where we are
We'll be alright, even if we're miles apart
All I wanna do
Is be with you, be with you
There's nothin' we can't do
Just wanna be with you, only you
No matter where life takes us
Nothin' can break us apart (You know it's true)
I just wanna be with you
Yeah, yeah (Just be with you)
You know how life can be, it changes overnight
It's sunny, then rainin', but it's alright
A friend like you always makes it easy
I know that you get me every time
Through every up, through every down
You know I'll always be around
Through anything, you can count on me
All I wanna do
Is be with you, be with you
There's nothin' we can't do
Just wanna be with you, only you
No matter where life takes us
Nothin' can break us apart (You know it's true)
I just wanna be with you
Take it back to the place where you know it all began
We could be anything we wanna be
You can tell by the noise that the boys are back again
Together, makin' history
It's time to show how
To be a superhero
Just like a showdown
Will Smith and Bobby De Niro
We're the best, no doubt
Doin' it like we used to do
This is our town
And I'm tellin' you, oh
The boys are back (Hey)
The boys are back (That's right)
The boys are back, gonna do it again
Gonna wake up the neighborhood
The boys are back (Yeah)
The boys are back (Alright)
Climbin' up the walls anytime we want
The word is out, the boys are back
The boys are back
Back to save the day
The boys are back, oh, yeah
Keep comin' with the right, win the fight every single time
Undefeated here in our house, yeah
We can rock, we can shock anytime we like
And tonight, we're goin' all out
It's time to show how
To be a superhero
Just like a showdown
Keep the pedal to the metal, go
We're the best, no doubt
Doin' it like we used to do
This is our town
And I'm tellin' you, oh (Look out)
The boys are back, gonna do it again
Gonna wake up the neighborhood
The boys are back (Yeah)
The boys are back (Alright)
Climbin' up the walls anytime we want
The word is out, the boys are back
Here to change the world
To solve the mystery, fight the battle, save the girl
(No one) No one can stop us now
We're the ones that make the rules
The boys are back
I guess I shoulda known better
To believe that my luck had changed (Luck had changed), ooh
I let my heart and forever
Finally learn each other's names (Other's names)
I tell myself, "This time, it's different"
No goodbyes 'cause I can't bear to say 'em
I'll never survive the one that's comin'
If I stay (If I stay), oh, no
Just walk away, oh, and don't look back
'Cause if my heart breaks, it's gonna hurt so bad
You know I'm strong, but I can't take that
Before it's too late
Oh, just walk away
I really wish I could blame you
But I know that it's no one's fault (It's no one's fault)
(No-no, no-no, ooh)
A Cinderella with no shoe
And a prince that doesn't know he's lost (Know he's lost)
This emptiness feels so familiar (Familiar)
Each goodbye, just the same old song
But this time, I will not surrender (Oh)
'Cause I'm gone ('Cause I'm gone), no, no
Just walk away, oh, and don't look back
'Cause if my heart breaks, it's gonna hurt so bad
You know I'm strong, but I can't take that
Before it's too late
Oh, just walk away
I've got to let it go, oh
Start protectin' my heart and soul
'Cause I don't think I'll survive a goodbye again
Not again
Just walk away, oh, and don't look back
'Cause if my heart breaks, it's gonna hurt so bad
You know I'm strong, but I can't take that
Before it's too late (Before it's too late)
Oh, just walk away
The day a door is closed
The echoes fill your soul
They won't say which way to go
Just trust your heart
To find what you're here for
Open another door
But I'm not sure anymore
It's just so hard
Voices in my head tell me they know best
Got me on the edge
They're pushin', pushin', they're pushin'
I know they've got a plan, but the ball's in my hands
This time, it's man to man
I'm drivin', fightin' inside a world that's upside down
And spinnin' faster
What do I do now, without you?
I don't know where to go
What's the right team?
I want my own thing
So bad I'm gonna scream
I can't choose, so confused
What's it all mean?
I want my own dream
So bad I'm gonna scream
I'm kickin' down the walls, I gotta make 'em fall
Just break through 'em all
I'm punchin', crashin', I'm gonna
Fight to find myself, me and no one else
Which way? I can't tell
I'm searchin', searchin'
Can't find the way that I should turn
I should turn, right or left?
It's, it's like nothin' works without you
I don't know where to go
What's the right team?
I want my own thing
So bad I'm gonna scream
I can't choose, so confused
What's it all mean?
I want my own dream
So bad I'm gonna scream
Yeah, the clock's runnin' down
Hear the crowd gettin' loud
I'm consumed by the sound
Is it her? Is it love?
Can the music ever be enough?
Gotta work it out, gotta work it out
You can do it, you can do it
I don't know where to go
What's the right team?
I want my own thing
So bad I'm gonna scream
I can't choose, so confused
What's it all mean?
I want my own dream
So bad I'm gonna scream
I don't know where to go
What's the right team?
I want my own thing
I want my own thing
I can't choose, so confused
What's it all mean?
I want my own dream
So bad I'm gonna scream
Here we go! (Woo!)
Little louder, now
Lookin' forward from center stage to graduation day
Time to get the future started
What we leave, what we take with us, no matter what
It's something we're part of
We learned to fly
Together, side by side (Side by side)
I just hope the rest of my life
Will feel as good as my...
High school musical

It's the best part we've ever known
Step into the future
But hold on to high school musical

Why can't the rest of my life

Now we finally realize
Who we are, it just took some time
We had to live and to learn to see the truth
(Learn to see the truth)
That nothing's ever impossible
Into the future, we all free-fall (Free-fall)
But forever, we'll always have high school
High...
Time to party, now, celebrate
