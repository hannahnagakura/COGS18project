I believe in dreamin'
Shootin' for the stars
Baby to be number one
You've got to raise the bar
Kickin' and a scratchin'
Grindin? out my best
Anything it takes
To climb the ladder of success
Work our tails off every day
Gotta bump the competition
Blow them all away
Yeah we're gonna
Bop, bop, bop
Bop to the top
Slip and slide and ride that rhythm
Jump and hop hop til we drop
And start again
Zip zap zop
Pop like a mop
Scoot around the corner
Move it to the groove
Til the music stops
Do the bop bop, bop to the top
Don't ever stop
Bop to the top
Gimmie, gimmie
Shimmy shimmy
Shake some booty and turn around
Flash a smile in their direction
Show some muscle
Do the hustle
Yeah we're gonna bop, bop, bop
Bop to the top
Wipe away your inhibitions
Stump, stump, stump do the rump
And strut your stuff
Bop, bop, bop
Straight to the top
Going for the glory
We'll keep stepping up
And we just won`t stop
'Til we reach the top
Bop to the top
We're soarin', flyin'
There's not a star in heaven
That we can't reach
If we're trying
So we're breaking free
You know the world can see us
In a way that's different than who we are
Creating space between us
'Til we're separate hearts
But your faith it gives me strength
Strength to believe
We're breakin' free
We're soarin'
Flyin'
There's not a star in heaven
That we can't reach
If we're trying
Yeah, we're breaking free
Oh, we're breakin' free
Ohhhh
Can you feel it building
Like a wave the ocean just can`t control
Connected by a feeling
Ohhh, in our very souls
Rising 'til it lifts us up
So every one can see
We're breakin' free
We're soarin'
Flyin'
There's not a star in heaven
That we can't reach
If we're trying
Yeah we're breaking free
Ohhhh runnin'
Climbin'
To get to that place
To be all that we can be
Now's the time
So we're breaking free
We're breaking free
Ohhh , yeah
More than hope
More than faith
This is true
This is fate
And together
We see it comin'
More than you
More than me
Not a want, but a need
Both of us breakin' free
Soarin'
Flyin'
There's not a star in heaven
That we can't reach
If we're trying
Yeah we're breaking free
Breaking free
Were runnin'
Ohhhh, climbin'
To get to the place
To be all that we can be
Now's the time
Now's the time
So we're breaking free
Ohhh, we're breaking free
Ohhhh
You know the world can see us
In a way that's different than who we are
Coach said to fake right
And break left
Watch out for the pick
And keep an eye on defense
Gotta run the give and go
And take the ball to the hole
But don't be afraid
To shoot the outside "J"
Just keep ya head in the game
Just keep ya head in the game
And don't be afraid
To shoot the outside "J"
Just keep ya head in the game
U gotta
Get'cha get'cha head in the game
We gotta
Get our, get our, get our, get our head in the game
Let's make sure
That we get the rebound
'Cause when we get it
Then the crowd will go wild
A second chance
Gotta grab it and go
Maybe this time
We'll hit the right notes
Wait a minute
It's not the time or place
Wait a minute
Get my head in the game
Wait a minute
Get my head in the game
Wait a minute
Wait a minute
I gotta
Get my, get my head in the game
You gotta
Get'cha, get'cha, get'cha, get'cha head in the game
Why am I feeling so wrong
My head's in the game
But my heart's in the song
She makes this feel so right
Should I go for it
Better shake this, yikes!
I gotta
Get my, get my head in the game
You gotta
Get'cha, get'cha, get'cha, get'cha head in the game
Living in my own world
Didn't understand
That anything can happen
When you take a chance
I never believed in
What I couldn't see
I never opened my heart
To all the possibilities
I know that something has changed
Never felt this way
And right here tonight
This could be the start
Of something new
It feels so right
To be here with you ..oh
And now ... looking in your eyes
I feel in my heart
The start of something new
Now who'd of ever thought that
We'd both be here tonight
And the world looks so much brighter
With you by my side
I know that something has changed
Never felt this way
I know it for real
This could be the start
Of something new
It feels so right
To be here with you
And now looking in your eyes
I feel in my heart
The start of something new
I never knew that it could happen
Till it happened to me
I didn't know it before
But now it's easy to see
It's a start
Of something new
It feels so right
To be here with you
And now looking in your eyes
I feel in my heart
That it's the start
Of something new
It feels so right
To be here with you
And now looking in your eyes
I feel in my heart
The start of something new
Start of something new
You can bet
There's nothin' but net
When I am in a zone and on a roll
But I've got a confession
My own secret obsession
And it's making me lose control
Everybody gather 'round
Well if Troy can tell his secret than I can tell mine...I bake
What?
I love to bake! Strudels, scones, even apple pandowdy
Not another sound
Someday I hope to make the perfect creme brulee
No, no, no, nooooooooooo
No, no, no
Stick to the stuff you know
If you wanna be cool
Follow one simple rule
Don't mess with the flow, no no
Stick to the status quo
Look at me
And what do you see
Intelligence beyond compare
But inside I am stirring
Something strange is occuring
It's a secret I need to share
Open up, dig way down deep
Hip hop is my passion! I love to pop and lock and jam and break!
Is that even legal?
Not another peep
It's just dancing. Sometimes I think it's cooler than homework.
No, no, no, noooooooooo
No, no, no
Stick to the stuff you know
It is better by far
To keep things as they are
Don't mess with the flow, no no
Stick to the status quo
Listen well
I'm ready to tell
About a need that I cannot deny
Dude, there's no explanation
For this awesome sensation
But I'm ready to let it fly
Speak your mind and you'll be heard
Alright, if Troy wants to be a singer... then i'm coming clean! I play the cello!
Awesome!
What is it?
A saw!
No, dude, it's like a giant violin!
Not another word
Do you have to wear a costume?
Coat and tie
No, no, no, nooooooooooo
No, no, no
Stick to the stuff you know
If you wanna be cool
Follow one simple rule
Don't mess with the flow, no no
Stick to the status quoooooooo
No, no, no
stick to the stuff you know
It is better by far
To keep things as they are
Don't mess with the flow, no no
Stick to the status quo
This is not what I want.
This is not what planned.
And I just gotta say, I do not understand.
Something is really...
Something's not right
Really wrong
And we gotta get things
Back where they belong
We can do it
Gotta play
Stick with what you know
We can do it
Hip hop hooray
She has got to go
We can do it
Creme Brule
Keep your voice down low
Not another peep
No, not another word
No, not another sound
No
Everybody quiet
Why is everybody staring at you?
Not me, you.
Because of the callbacks? I can't have people staring at me! I really can't!
Noooooooooooooo, no, no, no
Sick to the stuff you know
If you want to be cool
Follow one simple rule
Don't mess with the flow, oh no
Stick to the status quooooooooooooo
No, no, no
Stick to the stuff you know
It is better by far
To keep things as they are
Don't mess with the flow, no no
Stick to the status
stick to the status
Stick to the status quo
Together, together, together everyone
Together, together, come on let's have some fun
Together, were there for each other every time
Together together come on lets do this right
Here and now it's time for celebration
I finally figured it out (yeah yeah)
That all our dreams have no limitations
That's what it's all about
Everyone is special in their own way
We make each other strong (each other strong)
We're not the same
We're different in a good way
Together's where we belong
We're all in this together
Once we know
That we are
We're all stars
And we see that
We're all in this together
And it shows
When we stand
Hand in hand
Make our dreams come true
Together, together, together everyone
Together, together, come on let's have some fun
Together, were there for each other every time
Together together come on let's do this right
We're all here
and speaking out with one voice
we're going to rock the house (rock the house)
the party's on now everybody make some noise
come on scream and shout
We've arrived because we stuck together
Champions one and all
We're all in this together
Once we know
That we are
We're all stars
And we see that
We're all in this together
And it shows
When we stand
Hand in hand
Make our dreams come
We're all in this together
When we reach
We can fly
Know inside
We can make it
We're all in this together
Once we see
There's a chance
That we have
And we take it
Wild cats sing along
Yeah, you really got it goin' on
Wild cats in the house
Everybody say it now
Wild cats everywhere
Wave your hands up in the air
That's the way we do it
Let's get to it
Time to show the world
We're all in this together
Once we know
That we are
We're all stars
And we see that
We're all in this together
And it shows
When we stand
Hand in hand
Make our dreams come
We're all in this together
When we reach
We can fly
Know inside
We can make it
We're all in this together
Once we see
There's a chance
That we have
And we take it
Wild cats everywhere
Wave your hands up in the air
That's the way we do it
Let's get to it
Come on everyone!
It's hard to believe
That I couldn't see
You were always there beside me
Thought I was alone
With no one to hold
But you were always right beside me
This feelings like no other
I want you to know
I've never had someone that knows me like you do, the way you do
I've never had someone as good for me as you, no one like you
so lonely before I've finally found
what I've been looking for
So good to be seen
So good to be heard
Don't have to say a word
For so long I was lost
So good to be found
I'm loving having you around
This feeling's like no other
I want you to know
I've never had someone that knows me like you do
The way you do
I've never had someone as good for me as you
No one like you
So lonely before, I finally found
what I've been looking for
Doo Doo DooDoo
Doo Doo DooDoo
Do Do
Woa-ah-ah-oh
It's funny when you find yourself
Looking from the outside
I'm standing here but all I want
Is to be over there
Why did I let myself believe
Miracles could happen
Cause now I have to pretend
That I don't really care
I thought you were my fairytale
A dream when I'm not sleeping
A wish upon a star
Thats coming true
But everybody else could tell
That I confused my feelings with the truth
When there was me and you
I swore I knew the melody
That I heard you singing
And when you smiled
You made me feel
Like I could sing along
But then you went and changed the words
Now my heart is empty
I'm only left with used-to-be's
And once upon a song
Now I know you're not a fairytale
And dreams were meant for sleeping
And wishes on a star
Just don't come true
Cause now even I can tell
That I confused my feelings with the truth
Cause I liked the view
When there was me and you
I can't believe that
I could be so blind
It's like you were floating
While I was falling
And I didn't mind
Cause I liked the view
Thought you felt it too
When there was me and you
